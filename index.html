<h1>Interactive Fiction with Ink</h1>

<p>Welcome! This page guides you through creating interactive stories in Ink. Follow the steps and experiment with the code.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Install Inky</h2>
<p>Download <a href="https://www.inklestudios.com/inky/">Inky</a> to run your Ink stories.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Basic Story</h2>
<p>This is your first story with crossroads and choices:</p>

<pre><code>
=== start ===
You are at a crossroads.

+ [Go left] -> left
+ [Go right] -> right

=== left ===
You find a treasure chest!
You win!
+ [Play again] -> start

=== right ===
You fall into a trap!
Game over.
+ [Try again] -> start
</code></pre>

<p>Copy this code into Inky and play it. Notice the <code>=== knots ===</code> and <code>+ choices</code>.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Variables and Inventory</h2>
<p>Here’s a version with lives and a key:</p>

<pre><code>
VAR has_key = false
VAR lives = 3
VAR previous_knot = "start"

=== start ===
{lives > 0:
    What do you do at the crossroads?
    + [Go left] -> left
    + [Go right] -> right
    + [Check your backpack] -> check_inventory
- else:
    You’re out of lives! Game over.
    + [Try again?] -> restart_game
}

=== left ===
~ previous_knot = "left"
You find a shiny key!
{has_key == false:
    ~ has_key = true
    You pick it up and put it in your backpack.
- else:
    You already have the key.
}
+ [Go back] -> start

=== right ===
~ previous_knot = "right"
You fall into a trap!
~ lives = lives - 1
{lives > 0:
    You lose a life. You have {lives} lives left.
    -> start
- else:
    You’re out of lives! Game over.
    + [Try again?] -> restart_game
}

=== check_inventory ===
{has_key:
    You have a key in your backpack.
- else:
    Your backpack is empty.
}
+ [Return] -> return_from_inventory

=== return_from_inventory ===
-> {previous_knot}

=== restart_game ===
~ lives = 3
~ has_key = false
-> start
</code></pre>

<h2>Step 4: Play, Modify, Experiment</h2>
<p>Try these exercises:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a new knot with a hidden treasure.</li>
  <li>Make the right path lose 2 lives instead of 1.</li>
  <li>Add another item in the backpack.</li>
</ul>
