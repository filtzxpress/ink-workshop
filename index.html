<h1>Interactive Fiction with Ink – Beginner Friendly</h1>

<p>Welcome! This page guides you through making interactive stories using Ink. We’ll break down the code, explain variables, conditionals, knots, diverts, and what the computer actually does when you run the story. Don’t worry if some of this seems confusing at first — take it step by step.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Install Inky</h2>
<p>Download <a href="https://www.inklestudios.com/inky/">Inky</a> and open it on your computer. You’ll be able to copy the Ink code from this page, paste it into Inky, and test your stories live.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Basic Story – Knots, Choices, Diverts</h2>
<div class="explanation">
<strong>Knots:</strong> Named sections of your story. Think of them as chapters. The computer jumps between knots using diverts.<br>
<strong>Choices:</strong> What the player can select. In Ink, "+" creates choices that can be selected multiple times, "*" would create one-time choices.<br>
<strong>Diverts (->):</strong> Instructions telling the computer which knot to go to next. Without a divert, the story ends at the end of the current knot.<br>
<strong>Computer perspective:</strong> The computer reads the story top to bottom. When it sees a choice, it waits for input. When a choice is selected, it jumps (diverts) to the specified knot and continues reading.
</div>

<pre><code>
=== start ===          // Knot named "start"
You are at a crossroads.

+ [Go left] -> left    // Player chooses left -> jump to "left" knot
+ [Go right] -> right  // Player chooses right -> jump to "right" knot

=== left ===
You find a treasure chest!
You win!
+ [Play again] -> start // Diverts back to start knot

=== right ===
You fall into a trap!
Game over.
+ [Try again] -> start   // Diverts back to start knot
</code></pre>

<h2>Step 3: Variables, Conditionals, and Inventory</h2>
<div class="explanation">
<strong>Variables:</strong> Storage for information the computer tracks. Examples:<br>
- <strong>Boolean:</strong> True or false (e.g., has_key = false)<br>
- <strong>Integer:</strong> Whole numbers (e.g., lives = 3)<br>
<strong>How the computer uses variables:</strong> It keeps the current value in memory and updates it when the story code changes it. For example, if the player loses a life, the computer subtracts 1 from the lives variable.<br>
<strong>Conditionals:</strong> Blocks of text or actions that only happen if a certain condition is true. The computer checks the variable and decides which branch to run.<br>
<strong>Diverts within conditionals:</strong> The computer can jump to different knots depending on the result of a conditional. This lets your story flow differently based on what the player has done.
</div>

<pre><code>
VAR has_key = false      // Boolean: tracks if player has a key
VAR lives = 3            // Integer: tracks remaining lives
VAR previous_knot = "start"  // Remember the last knot for returning

=== start ===
{lives > 0:                       // Conditional: if lives > 0, continue
    What do you do at the crossroads?
    + [Go left] -> left
    + [Go right] -> right
    + [Check your backpack] -> check_inventory
- else:                           // Conditional fallback if lives <= 0
    You’re out of lives! Game over.
    + [Try again?] -> restart_game
}

=== left ===
~ previous_knot = "left"           // Update current location
You find a shiny key!
{has_key == false:                  // If player doesn't already have key
    ~ has_key = true               // Computer updates variable to true
    You put it in your backpack.
- else:
    You already have the key.
}
+ [Go back] -> start

=== right ===
~ previous_knot = "right"
You fall into a trap!
~ lives = lives - 1                 // Subtract 1 from lives
{lives > 0:
    You lose a life. You have {lives} lives left.
    -> start                       // Divert back to start
- else:
    You’re out of lives! Game over.
    + [Try again?] -> restart_game
}

=== check_inventory ===
{has_key:
    You have a key in your backpack.
- else:
    Your backpack is empty.
}
+ [Return] -> return_from_inventory

=== return_from_inventory ===
-> {previous_knot}                 // Divert back to previous knot

=== restart_game ===
~ lives = 3
~ has_key = false
-> start
</code></pre>

<h2>Step 4: Play, Modify, Experiment</h2>
<p>Try these exercises:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a new knot with a hidden treasure.</li>
  <li>Make the right path lose 2 lives instead of 1.</li>
  <li>Add another item in the backpack and track it with a Boolean variable.</li>
  <li>Experiment with conditionals: make some text or choices appear only if the player has a key.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 5: Resources</h2>
