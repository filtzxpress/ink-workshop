<h1>Interactive Fiction with Ink</h1>

<p>Welcome! This page guides you through creating interactive stories in Ink. Follow the steps and experiment with the code. Don’t worry if things feel confusing — we’ll explain variables, choices, knots, and diverts along the way.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Install Inky</h2>
<p>Download <a href="https://www.inklestudios.com/inky/">Inky</a> to run your Ink stories on your computer. You can open the code here and test it live.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Basic Story</h2>
<div class="explanation">
<strong>Knots:</strong> Sections of your story. Think of them like chapters. Each knot has a name and contains text and choices.<br>
<strong>Choices:</strong> What the player can do next. In Ink, "+" creates a choice that can be reused, while "*" creates a one-time choice.<br>
<strong>Diverts (->):</strong> These are instructions to jump to another knot. Without them, Ink doesn’t know where to go next.
</div>

<pre><code>
=== start ===          // Knot named "start"
You are at a crossroads.

+ [Go left] -> left    // Player chooses left, story jumps to "left" knot
+ [Go right] -> right  // Player chooses right, story jumps to "right" knot

=== left ===
You find a treasure chest!
You win!
+ [Play again] -> start // Diverts back to start knot

=== right ===
You fall into a trap!
Game over.
+ [Try again] -> start   // Diverts back to start knot
</code></pre>

<h2>Step 3: Variables and Inventory</h2>
<div class="explanation">
<strong>Variables:</strong> Store information about the story state. For example, “lives” counts how many chances the player has left. “has_key” tracks if the player picked up an item.<br>
<strong>Conditionals:</strong> Show text or change story flow depending on a variable. Example: if lives > 0, continue; otherwise, game over.<br>
<strong>Diverts in conditionals:</strong> You can use -> inside a conditional to send the player somewhere based on a variable’s value.
</div>

<pre><code>
VAR has_key = false   // Boolean variable: true/false
VAR lives = 3         // Integer variable: number of lives
VAR previous_knot = "start"  // Track where the player was

=== start ===
{lives > 0:                       // Conditional: if player has lives left
    What do you do at the crossroads?
    + [Go left] -> left
    + [Go right] -> right
    + [Check your backpack] -> check_inventory
- else:                           // Otherwise (no lives left)
    You’re out of lives! Game over.
    + [Try again?] -> restart_game
}

=== left ===
~ previous_knot = "left"           // Set variable to remember current knot
You find a shiny key!
{has_key == false:
    ~ has_key = true               // Pick up the key
    You put it in your backpack.
- else:
    You already have the key.
}
+ [Go back] -> start

=== right ===
~ previous_knot = "right"
You fall into a trap!
~ lives = lives - 1                 // Lose a life
{lives > 0:
    You lose a life. You have {lives} lives left.
    -> start
- else:
    You’re out of lives! Game over.
    + [Try again?] -> restart_game
}

=== check_inventory ===
{has_key:
    You have a key in your backpack.
- else:
    Your backpack is empty.
}
+ [Return] -> return_from_inventory

=== return_from_inventory ===
-> {previous_knot}                 // Return to previous knot

=== restart_game ===
~ lives = 3
~ has_key = false
-> start
</code></pre>

<h2>Step 4: Play, Modify, Experiment</h2>
<p>Try these exercises:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a new knot with a hidden treasure.</li>
  <li>Make the right path lose 2 lives instead of 1.</li>
  <li>Add another item in the backpack.</li>
</ul>
